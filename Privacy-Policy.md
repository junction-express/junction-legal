Privacy Policy
--------------

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Junction, we have a few fundamental principles:

-   We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
-   We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
-   We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
-   We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information. &&??
-   We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.

Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.

### Who We Are and What This Policy Covers

Hello! We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow anyone — from bloggers, to lawyers, small business owners, and enterprises — to take full advantage of the power and promise of the open web. Our mission is to democratize data storage and hosting so that anyone with a story can tell it, and anyone can turn their great idea into a livelihood. We believe in powering the open internet with code that is open source and are proud to say that the vast majority of our work is available under the General Public License ("GPLv3"). Unlike most other services, because our GPL code is public, you can actually download and take a look at that code to see how it works.

This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:

-   Our platform, junction.express;
-   Our other Junction products, services, and features that are available on or through our websites (for example, junction.express plans, the Payments feature, the Pay with razorpay block **)

This Privacy Policy also applies to information we collect when you apply for a job at Junction or one of our subsidiaries.

Throughout this Privacy Policy we'll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as "Services." 

Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.

### Creative Commons Sharealike License

We've decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a [Creative Commons Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. You can grab a copy of this Privacy Policy and other legal documents on [GitHub](https://github.com/Junction/legalmattic). You're more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. If you do use it, we'd appreciate a credit and link to Junction somewhere on your site. &&?? Do we credit automatic??

### Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.

We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let's go over the information that we collect.

#### *Information You Provide to Us*

It's probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:

-   **Basic account information: **We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a Junction.express account to provide an email address and password, along with your name — and that's it. You may provide us with more information — like your address and other information you want to share — but we don't require that information to create a Junction.express account.
-   **Public profile information:** If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a Junction.express account, your email is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo or an "About Me" description. Your public profile information is just that — public — so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
-   **Payment and contact information:** There are various ways in which you may provide us payment information and associated contact information. For example, if you buy something from us, we'll collect information to process those payments and contact you. If you buy something from us — a subscription to a Junction.express plan, you'll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information.
-   **Communications with us (hi there!): **You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question, post a question in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter like the one we send through Longreads. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, Junction.express comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).


#### *Information We Collect Automatically*

We also collect some information automatically:

-   **Log information:** Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example, when you create or make changes to your website on junction.express.
-   **Transactional information:** When you make a purchase through our Services, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and the date and location of the transaction.
-   **Usage information:** We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site using our Junction.express — in other words, who did what and when (e.g., [Junction.express name] deleted "[title of post]" at [time/date]). We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., number of API requests, IP address of the request, features enabled for your Junctions, interactions with our Interface and other parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention. &&??
-   **Location information:** We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.
-   **Information from cookies & other technologies:** A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Junction uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.


### How and Why We Use Information

#### *Purposes for Using Information*

We use information about you for the purposes listed below:

-   **To provide our Services.** For example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, provide customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information.
-   **To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.** For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.
-   **To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.** For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.
-   **To protect our Services, our users, and the public.** For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of Junction and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.
-   **To fix problems with our Services.** For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.
-   **To customize the user experience.** For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services, recommending content through our Reader post suggestions, and providing new essays and stories through Longreads for your reading pleasure.
-   **To communicate with you.** For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Junction; texting you to verify your payment; or calling you to share offers and promotions that we think will be of interest to you. If you don't want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we'll still send you important updates relating to your account.)

#### *Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information* &&??

A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:

(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or

(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or

(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or

(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or

(5) You have given us your consent — for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on.

### Sharing Information

#### *How We Share Information*

We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy.

-   **Subsidiaries and independent contractors:** We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them.
-   **Third-party vendors:** We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, cloud storage services, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, and your hosting provider if your site is not hosted by Junction); those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services); those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams); other third-party tools that help us manage operations; and companies that make products available on our websites, who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies.
-   **Legal and regulatory requirements:** We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information about Junction.express users.
-   **To protect rights, property, and others:** We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Junction, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
-   **Business transfers:** In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Junction goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
-   **With your consent:** We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so, like when you connected your site to a social media service through our Publicize feature.
-   **Aggregated or de-identified information:** We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.
-   **Published support requests:** If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.

#### *Information Shared Publicly*

Information that you choose to make public is — you guessed it — disclosed publicly.

That means information like your public profile, data objects, other content that you make public on your account — and we hope they get a lot of views!

For example, the photo that you upload to your public profile, or a default image if you haven't uploaded one, is your Avatar, along with other public profile information, while logged in to your Junction.express account. Your avatar and public profile information may also display with your comments, "collaboration" and other interactions on websites that use our service.

Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.


### Security

While no online service is 100% secure, we try to ensure protectection information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.

### Choices

You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

-   **Set your browser to reject cookies:** At this time, Junction does not respond to "do not track" signals across all of our Services. However, you can to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Junction's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Junction's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

-   **Close your account:** While we'd be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services. You can do so by sending us an email from your registered email id.

***Right to Opt Out*** &&?? thinking of removing this section

We never directly sell your personal information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money).

We may share your information as necessary with our third-party service providers to provide our services to you.

You can learn more about this sharing and how to opt out by clicking the "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link in the footer of our websites, or from the settings page within our apps. Note that in some instances this link will only display to individuals visiting our sites from within the relevant states.

Our opt-out is managed through cookies, so if you delete cookies, your browser is set to delete cookies automatically after a certain length of time, or if you visit sites in a different browser, you'll need to make this selection again.

We also respect the GPC browser signal and will treat it as a valid means of communicating your desire to opt out.

We do not collect or process your sensitive (and potentially sensitive) personal information except where it is strictly necessary to provide you with our service, where the processing is not for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you, or for other purposes that do not require an option to limit under California law. We don't knowingly sell or share personal information of those under 16.


#### *Contacting Us About These Rights*

You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren't able to or you'd like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to "How to rech us" to, well, find out how to reach us.

When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we'll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity with us.

#### ***Appeals Process for Rights Requests Denials***

In some circumstances we may deny your request to exercise one of these rights. For example, if we cannot verify that you are the account owner we may deny your request to access the personal information associated with your account. As another example, if we are legally required to maintain a copy of your personal information we may deny your request to delete your personal information.

In the event that we deny your request, we will communicate this fact to you in writing. You may appeal our decision by responding in writing to our denial email and stating that you would like to appeal. All appeals will be reviewed by an internal expert who was not involved in your original request. In the event that your appeal is also denied this information will be communicated to you in writing.  Please note that the appeal process does not apply to job applicants.


### Controllers and Responsible Companies

Junction's Services are worldwide. Different companies are the controller (or co-controller) of personal information, which means that they are the company responsible for processing that information, based on the particular service and the location of the individual using our Services.

Depending on the Services you use, more than one company may be the controller of your personal data. Generally, the "controller" is Samanvay Web Pvt. Ltd. company that entered into the contract with you under the Terms of Service for the product or service you use.
